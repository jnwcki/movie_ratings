Django site for accessing a movie ratings database
This was an assignment for the end of the fourth week at the Iron Yard. The objective was to build a site to access a database 
of movie ratings. Later I added api access views. The site allows searching of movies and calculates the top 20 based on highest
ratings. Also has views for movie and rater details.
